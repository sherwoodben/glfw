# EditorConfig for GLFW
#
# All files created by GLFW should indent with four spaces unless their format requires
# otherwise.  A few files still use other indent styles for historical reasons.
#
# Dependencies have (what seemed to be) their existing styles described.  Those with
# existing trailing whitespace have it preserved to avoid cluttering future commits.
#
# Changes have been made to this file (by sherwoodben) to reflect the stripped-down
# version of the repository (i.e. the forked repo which adds Premake functionality)
