# GLFW (with Premake!)

The main GLFW repository and all it's documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw).

All this fork has done is to provide a '/premake/' directory and a 'premake5.lua' script which can be included in other premake scripts to include glfw as a library in another project.

The (release, static) binary can be compiled in "stand-alone" mode _without_ being included in another project with the provided batch files.
