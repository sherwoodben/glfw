-- glfw premake script v1.0
-- Benjamin Sherwood, 2025

-- assume that if we're calling this premake file we are NOT building glfw "individually"
-- that is, it is instead being built as a dependency for another project. At this point,
-- we will _always and only_ build as a static library

-- in this case, we _could_ create a special workspace for "vendor" libraries, OR we could
-- just stick this project in the GLOBAL workspace. That's the option we'll go with, making
-- use of the special '*' workspace name. THIS WILL NOT WORK if there is not actually a
-- workspace that has been defined! In other words, be sure to INCLUDE this premake file in
-- the "parent" premake file!

-- we also provide an option to make a "stand-alone" version which _will_ provide a workspace
